## 📖 Description

This project replicates the logic of the Wordle game in a text-based format.  
It selects a random word from a predefined list and gives the player feedback after each guess:
- 🟩 Green: Correct letter in the correct position  
- 🟨 Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position  
- ⬜ Gray: Incorrect letter  

The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
